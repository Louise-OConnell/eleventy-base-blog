## Ingredients 

Wrights chocolate fudge cake mixture

4 tbsp vegetable oil

200ml water

Ready made chocolate frosting

Cherry fruit filling (red or black cherry)

Love-heart sprinkles or chocolate love-hearts (to decorate)


Steps to follow:

1. Place 200ml of cold water, 4 tbsp of vegetable oil, and the full bag of Wright's cake mixture into a bowl. Blend ingredients until smooth. 

2. Pour cake mixture into a lined baking tin - I like to use tin foil to line my tin, and bake in the oven at 160-180 degrees, or 140-160 degrees for fan-assisted ovens, or Gas Mark 4, for 50-60 minutes. 

3. Remove the cake from the oven, and allow to cool for 10-15 minutes.

4. Cut the cake in half. Spread 2-3 tbsp of chocolate frosting on the bottom of the top cake layer, and spread a generous amount of the cherry fruit filling onto the top of the bottom cake layer. Then sandwich both the top and bottom of the cake layers together.

5. Spread a little bit of the cherry filling sauce on top of the cake, then spread the rest of the chocolate frosting on the top and sides of the cake.

6. Finish by adding love-heart sprinkles or chocolate love-hearts on top. 

7. Cut a slice and enjoy!
